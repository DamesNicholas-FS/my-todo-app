# 1.4 Exercise 01: Library Tutorial
## QuickSpace
QuickSpace is an idea that I came up with when I need to share a business card quickly. But I wanted to share a business card with somebody you need to pay me and I didn't wanna give out my phone number or use Venmo or something like that. I needed a secure, easy way for me to handle information without sacrificing privacy.

QuickSpace allows you to share contact information in links without having to use things like AirDrop, Bluetooth transfer, SMS, or Facebook contact information. You scan the QR Code to share what you want.

For example, if I wanted to share my QuickSpace, and I only wanted to allow people to visit a website or pay me, I can turn those features on and off through the settings without having to share a phone number.

This will be another great tool for people to share for using business cards. I hope to turn this into a personal and business type product
